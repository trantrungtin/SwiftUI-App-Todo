## What is Alternate iOS App Icon?

<p align="leading">
 Learn how to dynamically change app icons in your iOS apps. Every app needs a beautiful and memorable icon that attracts attention in the App Store and stands out on the Home screen. Your icon is the first opportunity to communicate, at a glance, your app’s purpose. It also appears throughout the system, such as in Settings and search results.

App customization is a feature that evokes a personal connection and enhances user experience. If it provides value in your app, you can let people select an alternate app icon from a set of predefined icons that are embedded within your app.
